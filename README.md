### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matheus Maciel Soares. Nice to meet you!
I've been working with software development since 2012 and have a BsC in Computer Science.

From 2012 to 2021, I've worked at large companies (SAP and ADP). Most recently, on mid 2021, I've decided to try something new and got into the startup world, and I'm currently working at a fintech called [Argyle](https://argyle.com/).

I have experience with a variety of programming languages and frameworks. Most of my work was done with the following:

**Programming languages**
- Java
- Javascript (Node.JS)
- Python

**Frameworks**
* SpringBoot
* Express
* Serverless (with AWS Lambda)
* Django

**Cloud providers**
- AWS
- Google Cloud Platform

**Databases**
- Oracle
- Postgres
- MySQL
- MongoDB

**Messaging**
- Apache Kafka
- RabbitMQ

Although I'm primarily a back end developer, I also have some front end experience with JQuery, Angular and React.
